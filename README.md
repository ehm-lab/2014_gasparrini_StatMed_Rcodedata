### Extending distributed lag non-linear models beyond time series data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An example illustrating the extension of distributed lag linear and non-linear models (DLMs and DLNMs) for modelling exposure-lag-response associations beyond time series analysis. The code completely reproduces the examples and simulation study described in the article:

Gasparrini A. Modeling exposure–lag–response associations with distributed lag non-linear models. *Statistics in Medicine*. 2014;**33**(5):881-899. [[freely available here](http://www.ag-myresearch.com/2014_gasparrini_statmed.html)]

This is complemented by the vignette *dlnmExtended* included in the [R package dlnm](https://github.com/gasparrini/dlnm), showing applications in alternative study designs.

The code:

-   *uminers.csv* stores the data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort, including individual information for 3,347 male subjects
-   the numbered files from *00.prep.R* to *08.simres.R* reproduce the results of the illustrative example and of the simulation study
-   *example.R* offers a simple example with of fitting some models and displaying/summarizing the results
-   *functions.R* creates some functions used in the other scripts
-   *simprep.R* and *simrun.R* are called from the other scripts for preparing and running the simulations
